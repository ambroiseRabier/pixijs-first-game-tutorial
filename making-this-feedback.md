## Journal

First pass, I started making/learning/writing this this pixiJS app. 
Then it fell off and on the part that did not need much explanation I just did something that worked.
For second pass, I preferred not to have multiple folder giving a different state of the project, as you would often have seen.
Because it does not give an accurate representation of the project combined with the configuration part of npm/ts/webpack.
I tough of rebasing and modifying previous commits, but, I would lose informations, it would be complex, and exactly knowing what to put 
between which commit would be hell quickly if I was to make substantial changes.
Finally I decided to just restart the project in the same repository, keeping my git history, and testing my own tutorial against myself.
This have proven rather successful.
I also made a hard copy of the latest state of my project into another folder and opened it with another webstorm window. Instead of relying on
github, that would have been to slow to quickly compare both projects. Why is it useful? there are some change in configuration that I have done in 
the middle of the project, but that should be there in the first step.


## Feedback presentation 29 january 2020

- Markdown pas évident à lire pr moi, préférer version compiler react markdown.
- NodeJS avec IDE en local bien plus facile, on voit la console, pas de CORS sur image. Utiliser NVM pour installer nodeJS ss droit d'admin.
- Github je peux pas clone de projet, proxy.
- Voir mon second écran, en face de moi, plus facile.
- Il y a de l'intérêt de plusieurs personnes.
- Laisser des choix créatifs est bienvenue.
